## Is this toolchain only for bluegrass and nothing else?

lol no.

This tool chain probably makes sense for many styles of creativity which leverage a remix culture and which thrive outside the intellectual property industrial complex.  Specifically, it seems that genres like hip hop, jazz, and some genres of electronic music makes sense for this toolchain.  We don't anticipate widespread adoption by mainstream pop.
