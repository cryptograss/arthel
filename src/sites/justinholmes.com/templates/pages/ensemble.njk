            What constitutes... mutability? In a band?
        </p>
            <p>
            Every time I take the stage (or at least, at each new stop on a tour); every time I put on cans in the
            studio, I feel a process of instantiation - a new instance of Band. Our setlist is unique each night; our
            arrangements and effects are often chosen (and signaled to one another) in the moment.
        </p>
            <p>
            In my journey to write logic that is the internet I want to see - from hacking together a viable
            battlestation for myself to play games with my kiddo, to legacy enterprise web apps, to custom dapps for
            this production, I have had many notions in my head (sometimes literally in my dreams) about mutability and
            its role in mapping the metaphor of the mind into a codebase, and particularly object orientation.
        </p>
            <p>
            Some of the most important friends I've made along the way are those who have chosen to play (and sometimes
            write) music with me.
        </p>
            <p>
            And their contributions don't seem to me to be a small part of some persistent monolith that belongs to me;
            instead, they feel each like their own distinct and complete creation.
        </p>
            <p>
            I hope you have enjoyed the shows and records that these folks have made with me as much as I've enjoyed
            their company, and I especially hope that you see fit to visit us again and contribute your ears and
            energies to the instantiation of new setlists and sounds.
