Although I've been singing my whole life and playing guitar for about 25 years, I didn't begin my professional music journey until 2022, on my 40th birthday.

Prior to 2022, I was an avid amateur musician, but I was much more known for my work in the field of software engineering and cryptology, and my particular proclivity for performing live software demos, which I was blessed to do all over the world for several years. It was the rigor of the audiences in these stage appearances that pushed me to finally take the plunge and play complex styles of traditional appalachian music.
