From Bill to Brewster is a talk track and story, about the journey of bluegrass down from the mountains and into the cities, bringing with it a corpus and model of music sustained outside the intellectual property industrial complex.  It tells the evolution of this corpus into the psychedelic era through bands like the Grateful Dead, and how that movement prefigured the internet we have today, especially including institutions like the Electric Frontier Foundation, the Long Now Foundation, and the Internet Archive.

The story was featured on The Green Pill podcast in 2024.
