) of the 1934 Lomax collection, "American Ballads and Folk Songs."

Here are some lyrics I like to sing, and the lomax paragraphs that inspire them:


(lomax 1)<br>
I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone<br>
...<br>
Gonna miss your baby, rolling in your arms<br>

(lomax 6)<br>
Sure as the birds fly in the sky above<br>
...<br>
Life is worth living when you're with the man you love<br>

(lomax 3)<br>
I laid down last night Lord but did not take my rest<br>
...<br>
my mind was racing like wild geese from the west<br>

(lomax 2)<br>
I'm going down the road where I'll get better care<br>
...<br>
I believe I'll go, and you'll be welcome there<br>

(lomax 10)<br>
I know the sun will shine in my back door<br>
...<br>
The cage will close, but I won't be inside no more<br>

(lomax 9)<br>
I'll cut your wood, babe and I'll build you a fire<br>
...<br>
I'll tote your water from the rondout reservoir<br>
